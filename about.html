                <p>SC Live is created with the mission to bring USC students together one concert at a time. The primary goal of the website is to help student organizations and/or musicians to publicize their concert events. All they need to do is fill out a form to provide details on their concert and we will work on the back end to upload their information on an interactive calendar and map. Additionally, they can request to get connected to graphic designers and photographers.
                    We believe that the website has the potential to gain wide exposure because it attracts students from all backgrounds and it serves a variety of needs. Ultimately, we hope that SC Live can become a budding online hub that USC students use to seek help or to seek fun!
